# Angular-6 Employee-Tracker SPA

This Demo-Project tracks the Information of a handful of Employees in a Fictitious Company. 
Each Employee-Information is rendered as a Digital-Card which contains the Employee's Thumbnails, Identification Number,
Position, Department and Tracking-ID. Clicking on the Employee-Thumbnail renders all the details of the Employee
on the Detail-Pane to the right.... This Demo is for good for Beginners who would like to understand the basics of Angular 6.
One cute feature of this Project is that it offers Real-Time, Dynamic Search. See also the `-SCREENSHOT-.png` File...
